# Changelog

### `0.1.1`

- Fixed namespacing issue with CTEs-- all CTEs generated by `dbt_linreg` now start with `_dbt_linreg_`, to reduce namespace conflicts with user generated SQL.
- Locked the dbt-core version requirement to `>=1.2.0` (for now) because one of this package's dependencies (`modules.itertools.combinations`) is not available prior to `1.2.0`.

### `0.1.0`

- Initial release
